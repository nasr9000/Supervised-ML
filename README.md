Credit Risk Analysis Report

 Explain the purpose of this assignment

The purpose of this assignment was for us to create and evaluate the accuracy of data models that allow us to evaluate the worthiness of potential borrowers from lending services.


Data 

The data that we decided to use here is a list of various different business entities and their credit risk/lending risk data. Some of these variables included in this are interest_rate, loan_size, debt_to_income, total_debt, and borrower_income. We have used these variables along with the remaining in this dataset to create two different models that allow us to compare which yielded the best results for our lending services. 

Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy score, the precision score, and recall score of the machine learning model.

   Model 1
   
1. Balanced Accuracy Score: %95.44 ---> This is taking account of the true positive and negative rate of the model. This is the balanced accuracy score.
2. Precision Score: %0.92 ---> This result indicates that %92 of predicted positive values were correct
3. Recall Score: %0.95 ---> This means that the model was 95% precise in measuring true positive values out of all positive predictions made.
  
   Model 2
   
4. Balanced Accuracy Score: %100 ---> This is taking account of the true positive and negative rate of the model. This is the balanced accuracy score %100.
5. Precision Score: %100 --->  This result indicates that %100 of predicted positive values were correct
6. Recall Score: %100 ---> This means that the model was 100% precise in measuring true positive values out of all positive predictions made.

Recommendations:

I would recommend using Model 2 to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers because it has at least 99% accuracy in predicting the outcome of the repayment of the initial loan. That accuracy range could be easily utilized for a risk portfolio to ensure sufficient capital flow for the lenders to remain in business/make a profit. It has demonstrated the least amount of error and therefore we can move forward as this is our most accurate option.
